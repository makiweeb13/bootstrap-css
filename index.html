                    <p>Wednesday Addams is expelled from her school after dumping live piranhas into the school's pool in retaliation for the boys' water polo team bullying her brother Pugsley. Consequently, her parents Gomez and Morticia Addams enroll her at their high school alma mater Nevermore Academy, a private school for monstrous outcasts, in the town of Jericho, Vermont. Wednesday's cold, emotionless personality and her defiant nature make it difficult for her to connect with her schoolmates and cause her to run afoul of the school's principal Larissa Weems. However, she discovers she has inherited her mother's psychic abilities which allow her to solve a local murder mystery. Smart, sarcastic and a little dead inside, Wednesday Addams investigates a murder spree while making new friends — and foes — at Nevermore Academy.</p>

            <h2>About Wednesday</h2>
            <p>Wednesday Addams first came to life in a comic strip created by Charles Addams in 1938 called The Addams Family. The family was first published in The New Yorker as a single-panel cartoon, where they were initially nameless. It wasn’t until the series was later adapted for television in 1964 that Wednesday was blessed with her iconic name. Supposedly, her name was inspired by the well-known nursery rhyme that includes the line “Wednesday’s child is full of woe”. Full of woe, indeed. In the cartoons, she was depicted as a small and pale child with an ever-lacking smile and a love for the macabre. Alongside Wednesday is her family, including her mother Morticia (the character that continues to provide a go-to Halloween costume for tall, beautiful and sharp-jawed women), her father Gomez (short king and husband goals) and brother Pugsley.</p>
